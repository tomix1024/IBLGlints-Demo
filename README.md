Real-time Image-based Lighting of Glints (Demo)
===============================================


Overview
--------

We have introduced an extension to real-time image-based lighting at EGSR 2025.
This repository contains a Unity3D project that demonstrates real-time rendering of glints under image-based lighting [KK25], area lights [KK24] and directional lights [DB23] (modified based on area-light theory).
We provide a modified version of Unity3D's High Definition Render Pipeline containing our implementation [including parts of previous work](https://thomasdeliot.wixsite.com/blog/single-post/hpg23-real-time-rendering-of-glinty-appearance-using-distributed-binomial-laws-on-anisotropic-grids).

Project Structure
-----------------

A copy of the HDRP and core render pipelines are found in the `Packages/` directory.
Our implementation modifies the `HDRP/Lit` shader in the HDRP.
The relevant entry points for the glint evaluation are found in `Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@14.0.10/Runtime/Material/Lit/Lit.hlsl` in the functions
- `IndirectLighting EvaluateBSDF_Env(...)`
- `DirectLighting EvaluateBSDF_Rect(...)`
- `CBSDF EvaluateBSDF(...)`

The binomial is then implemented in the files `Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition/Runtime/Material/Glints/Glints*.hlsl`.

The Unity Project itself contains the demo scene that can be built into an executable.


Precompiled Binaries
--------------------

Precompiled binaries can be found in a not yet disclosed location for Linux and Windows.
